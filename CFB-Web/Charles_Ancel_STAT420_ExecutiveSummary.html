<h1 class="unnumbered" id="introduction">Introduction</h1>
<p>This report delves deeply into a dataset that covers twenty years of
college football games, a period marked by significant changes and
advancements in the sport. Through our analysis, we utilize this data to
explore factors influencing team performance and the excitement level of
the games. The dataset provides information on teams, scores, game
dates, and features like the ’excitement index’, offering a perspective
on the sport’s evolution and competitive landscape.</p>
<h1 class="unnumbered" id="results">Results</h1>
<p>Our analytical process uncovers intricate patterns in college
football dynamics. The model emphasizes the role of home and away team
ELO ratings, indicating a strong connection with game outcomes.
Additionally, the ’excitement index’ plays a pivotal role, showing a
correlation with audience engagement and game dynamics. Throughout our
modeling process, we rigorously tested combinations of variables,
gaining a nuanced understanding of how different factors interact to
impact game results. Our iterative approach ensures not only statistical
validity but also contextual relevance.</p>
<h1 class="unnumbered" id="discussion">Discussion</h1>
<p>The implications of our findings extend beyond statistical
significance. For instance, recognizing the role ELO ratings play in
predicting game outcomes can guide teams in enhancing their performance
strategies, especially in high-stakes matches. Furthermore, the
correlation between the excitement index and game outcomes offers
insights into fan engagement, suggesting that more thrilling games have
the potential to attract larger audiences. These insights are invaluable
for stakeholders in the college football industry, providing a
data-driven foundation for decision-making, from team management to
marketing strategies. The model serves as a valuable tool for optimizing
both on-field performance and audience engagement strategies.</p>
<h1 class="unnumbered" id="statistical-test-results">Statistical Test
Results</h1>
<p>In our analysis, we performed a t-test to compare mean total wins
between conference and non-conference games. Our null hypothesis stated
no difference in means (<span
class="math inline"><em>H</em><sub>0</sub> : <em>μ</em><sub>conference</sub> = <em>μ</em><sub>non-conference</sub></span>),
while the alternative hypothesis suggested a significant difference
(<span
class="math inline"><em>H</em><sub><em>A</em></sub> : <em>μ</em><sub>conference</sub> ≠ <em>μ</em><sub>non-conference</sub></span>).
The t-test results showed a t-value of -5.7939 with a p-value of
7.14e-09, leading us to reject the null hypothesis. We conclude that
there is a statistically significant difference in mean total wins, with
conference games having a lower mean than non-conference games. This
finding implies that the type of game significantly affects total wins,
an important consideration for team strategies and league structure.</p>
<h1 class="unnumbered" id="practical-considerations">Practical
Considerations</h1>
<p>Despite the dataset’s comprehensive nature, there are limitations,
such as the potential exclusion of factors like weather conditions or
player injuries that can impact game outcomes. Future analyses could
explore these additional variables or employ advanced statistical
methods to enhance understanding. Stakeholders should be cautious in
applying these insights, keeping in mind the potential biases and
limitations of the dataset.</p>
