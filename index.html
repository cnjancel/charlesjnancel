        <h2>About Me</h2>
        <p>I'm Charles Ancel, a recent graduate from the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign with a B.Sc. in Mathematics and a minor in Economics. I have a strong background in advanced mathematics, statistical modeling, and economic analysis, including Real Analysis and Abstract Algebra. I am passionate about data-driven problem-solving and have developed expertise in econometrics, predictive modeling, and financial data analysis.</p>
            
        <p>One of my key independent projects involved developing a comprehensive model to assess the impact of monetary policy using time-series data and predictive analytics, demonstrating my advanced skills in econometrics and data interpretation. My professional experience includes roles as a Design Assistant at FTD LLC, where I optimized pricing strategies, and as a Logistics Coordinator for the Rose Parade, where I honed my leadership and project management skills.</p>
            
        <p>In my free time, I enjoy exploring new data visualization techniques, climbing, and continuously expanding my knowledge in economics and financial markets. I thrive on challenges that allow me to merge my analytical skills with creative problem-solving to deliver impactful insights.</p>
