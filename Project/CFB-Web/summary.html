            <h2>Executive Summary</h2>
            <h3>Introduction</h3>
            <p>This report delves deeply into a dataset that covers twenty years of college football games, a period marked by significant changes and advancements in the sport. Through our analysis, we utilize this data to explore factors influencing team performance and the excitement level of the games. The dataset provides information on teams, scores, game dates, and features like the ‘excitement index’, offering a perspective on the sport’s evolution and competitive landscape.</p>
            <h3>Results</h3>
            <p>Our analytical process uncovers intricate patterns in college football dynamics. The model emphasizes the role of home and away team ELO ratings, indicating a strong connection with game outcomes. Additionally, the 'excitement index' plays a pivotal role, showing a correlation with audience engagement and game dynamics. Throughout our modeling process, we rigorously tested combinations of variables, gaining a nuanced understanding of how different factors interact to impact game results. Our iterative approach ensures not only statistical validity but also contextual relevance.</p>
            <h3>Discussion</h3>
            <p>The implications of our findings extend beyond statistical significance. Recognizing the role ELO ratings play in predicting game outcomes can guide teams in enhancing their performance strategies, especially in high-stakes matches. Furthermore, the correlation between the excitement index and game outcomes offers insights into fan engagement, suggesting that more thrilling games have the potential to attract larger audiences. These insights are invaluable for stakeholders in the college football industry, providing a data-driven foundation for decision-making, from team management to marketing strategies. The model serves as a valuable tool for optimizing both on-field performance and audience engagement strategies.</p>
